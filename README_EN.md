## üöÄ Quick Start

### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

| Dependency     | Version/Requirement | Note                |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| SpringBoot     | 3.3.6              |                     |
| Spring AI      | 1.0.0              |                     |
| JDK            | 21+                |                     |
| Maven          | 3.6+               |                     |
| Docker         | (for running Milvus)|                     |

### 1. üß¨ Clone the Project

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/java-ai-tech/spring-ai-summary.git
# Enter the project directory and compile
cd spring-ai-summary && mvn clean compile -DskipTests
```

> If you encounter slow Maven dependency downloads, try using a domestic Maven mirror (e.g., Aliyun, Tsinghua). For any other issues, feel free to join the WeChat group above for discussion and support.

### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Configure Environment Variables

For each module, configure the required API keys in the `application.yml`/`application.properties` file under the `resources` folder. For example, in **spring-ai-chat-deepseek**:

```properties
# because we do not use the OpenAI protocol
spring.ai.deepseek.api-key=${spring.ai.deepseek.api-key}
spring.ai.deepseek.base-url=https://api.deepseek.com
spring.ai.deepseek.chat.completions-path=/v1/chat/completions
spring.ai.deepseek.chat.options.model=deepseek-chat
```
Replace `spring.ai.deepseek.api-key` with your actual API key to start the service. For how to apply for an API key, see the project [Wiki page](https://github.com/java-ai-tech/spring-ai-summary/wiki).

### 3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Examples

After the above steps, you can run different modules to experience Spring AI features. For example, to start **spring-ai-chat-deepseek** (port may vary):

```bash
2025-06-04T14:18:43.939+08:00  INFO 88446 --- [spring-ai-chat-deepseek] [           main] c.g.ai.chat.deepseek.DsChatApplication   : Starting DsChatApplication using Java 21.0.2 with PID 88446 (/Users/glmapper/Documents/projects/glmapper/spring-ai-summary/spring-ai-chat/spring-ai-chat-deepseek/target/classes started by glmapper in /Users/glmapper/Documents/projects/glmapper/spring-ai-summary)
...
```
Once started, you can test with cUrl, HTTPie, or Postman:

```bash
curl localhost:8081/api/deepseek/chatWithMetric?userInput="Who are you?"
```
Result:

![chat-ds-metrics.png](docs/statics/chat-ds-metrics.png)

You can also check token usage:

```bash
# completion tokens
http://localhost:8081/actuator/metrics/ai.completion.tokens
# prompt tokens
http://localhost:8081/actuator/metrics/ai.prompt.tokens
# total tokens
http://localhost:8081/actuator/metrics/ai.total.tokens
```
Example response for `ai.completion.tokens`:
```json
{
   "name": "ai.completion.tokens",
   "measurements": [
      {
         "statistic": "COUNT",
         "value": 34
      }
   ],
   "availableTags": []
}
```

**For usage and configuration of other modules, see the [Wiki page](https://github.com/java-ai-tech/spring-ai-summary/wiki) or each module's `README.md`.**
